\chapter{Introduction}


We begin our journey with a consideration of ``size'', or ``counting''.
To count the size of something $A$ we write $\euler(A).$
Size is \emph{additive} in the sense of 
$\euler(A\cup B) = \euler(A) + \euler(B)$ except that
$A$ and $B$ may have intersection.
In this case we would have counted the 
size of the intersection twice and so we modify this formula as
$$
    \euler(A\cup B) = \euler(A) + \euler(B) - \euler(A\cap B).
$$
We can continue this idea to find the
size of the union of three pieces
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{pic-ABC.pdf}
\end{center}
In this case the formula reads:
\begin{align}\label{EulerAddSub}
\euler(A\cup B\cup C) = \ &\euler(A) + \euler(B) + \euler(C)  \nonumber \\
                     &- \euler(A\cap B) - \euler(A\cap C) - \euler(B\cap C) \nonumber \\
                     &+ \euler(A\cap B \cap C).
\end{align}
The point here is the alternating signs:
each time we try to count a size we overcount by
one intersections worth, subtracting those intersections
goes too far in the opposite direction and so we need
to add intersections of intersections, and so on.

We now wish to apply this idea to count the
size of a sphere. The trick here is to tile the
sphere with the faces of a cube:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{pic-cube.pdf}
\end{center}
So we have six faces and one might suggest that 
$\euler(S^2)=6$ but these are closed faces, so they
intersect on their edges, of which we have 12.
But these edges intersect at vertices and there are
8 of these. 
We extend the above formula \Eref{EulerAddSub} to calculate:
$$
    \euler(S^2) = 6 - 12 + 8 = 2.
$$
So the sphere has ``size'' two!
The magic here is that any other convex polyhedron would give
the same answer of two.
This, of course, is known as the \emph{Euler characteristic},
and for a sphere this is indeed two.

We repeat this calculation for another surface, a torus.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{pic-torus.pdf}
\end{center}
This time we use four faces, eight edges and four vertices:
$$
    \euler(S^1\times S^1) = 4 - 8 + 4 = 0.
$$

The Euler characteristic has many equivalent definitions,
and we now turn to one of these.
%The first step is to consider vector spaces ...
We are going to replace sets of things by vector
spaces whose basis is the original set.
And just to keep things simple we will 
take our vector spaces over the finite field with
two elements $\Field=\{0, 1\}.$
%That is, we use mod 2 arithmetic when counting things.
This has the distinct advantage
of eliminating all sign errors!

From the set of faces we form a vector space
$C_2$ with basis the set of faces.
Similarly, the one-dimensional pieces are the basis of $C_1$
and the zero-dimensional pieces are the basis of $C_0$:
\begin{align*}
    C_2 &: \mbox{faces},\\
    C_1 &: \mbox{edges},\\
    C_0 &: \mbox{vertices.}
\end{align*}
So the formula for Euler characteristic now reads:
\begin{align}\label{EulerEq}
    \euler(C_{\bullet}) = \mbox{dim}(C_2) - \mbox{dim}(C_1) + \mbox{dim}(C_0).
\end{align}
But now things get more interesting,
because we have linear operators:
\begin{align}\label{Sequence}
    C_2 \xrightarrow{\ \ \partial_2\ \ } C_1 \xrightarrow{\ \ \partial_1\ \ } C_0.
\end{align}
These operators are defined to take the ``boundary'' of a shape. 
The operator $\partial_2$ gives the boundary of a face $f\in C_2$
which is just the sum of edges incident to (contained by) that face:
$$
    \partial_2(f) = \sum_{\substack{e\in \text{edges},\\e\sim f}} e.
$$
where we use $\sim$ to indicate incidence, and we extend
$\partial_2$ to all of $C_2$ by linearity.
Similarly, $\partial_1$ is defined to take an edge
to the sum over its vertex endpoints:
$$
    \partial_1(e) = \sum_{\substack{v\in \text{vertices},\\v\sim e}} v.
$$

Now with a small amount of thought one finds that 
$$
    \partial_1 \circ \partial_2 = 0.
$$
This is because each vertex around a face gets counted twice,
and this is zero in $\Field$-linear arithmetic.
\begin{center}
%\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{pic-bdy.pdf}
\includegraphics{pic-bdy.pdf}
\end{center}
In other words, the boundary of the boundary is empty!
Or equivalently,
$$
    \Im(\partial_2) \subset \Ker(\partial_1).
$$
%We call the subspace $\Ker(\partial_1)$ the \emph{cycles}
%of $C_1$. 
The subspace $\Ker(\partial_1)$ of $C_1$
will be sums of edges that form closed loops, and we
call these \emph{cycles}.
The subspace $\Im(\partial_2)$ is the space of \emph{boundaries}.
So the above formula
says the space of boundaries is contained within the space of cycles.
This allows us to define the following quotient,
known as the first \emph{homology} group:
$$
    H_1 := \Ker(\partial_1) / \Im(\partial_2).
$$
These are the cycles modulo boundaries.

With a bit more work we can extend the above sequence \Eref{Sequence} to
$$
  0 \xrightarrow{\ \ \partial_3\ \ } 
    C_2 \xrightarrow{\ \ \partial_2\ \ } 
    C_1 \xrightarrow{\ \ \partial_1\ \ } 
    C_0 \xrightarrow{\ \ \partial_0\ \ } 0
$$
so that $\partial_i \circ \partial_{i+1}=0$ 
for $i=0,1,2$
and then define
$$
    H_i := \Ker(\partial_i) / \Im(\partial_{i+1}),\ \ \ \mbox{for}\ \ \ i=0,1,2.
$$

Now we have a new formula for the Euler characteristic,
\begin{align}\label{EulerHom}
    \euler(H_{\bullet}) = \mbox{dim}(H_2) - \mbox{dim}(H_1) + \mbox{dim}(H_0),
\end{align}
which follows from
%from the homology condition
%$\partial_i \circ \partial_{i+1}=0$  and
an application of the rank-nullity theorem to
equation \Eref{EulerEq}.

Going back to the torus example, with four faces,
eight edges and four vertices:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{pic-torus-hom.pdf}
\end{center}
we see that the sum over all faces in $C_2$
has zero boundary,
$$
    \partial_2(\sum_{f\in\text{faces}} f) = 0
$$
and this is the only vector with zero boundary so that
that $\Dim(H_2)=1$.
The space $H_1$ is two dimensional, with representative
cycles given by a vertical or horizontal loop of edges.
Finally, the space $H_0$ is one dimensional: these
are single points.
Putting this together we get
$$
    \euler(S^1\times S^1) = 
    \mbox{dim}(H_2) - \mbox{dim}(H_1) + \mbox{dim}(H_0) = 1-2-1 = 0,
$$
which agrees with our previous calculation for the Euler
characteristic of the torus.

%Because we have $\partial_3=0$ and $\partial_0=0$ this formula
%becomes
%\begin{align}
%    \euler(H_{\bullet}) = \Dim(\Ker{\partial_2}) - \dim(H_1) + \dim(\Im{\partial).
%\end{align}

This is all great but what does it have to do with quantum codes?
If we think of our finite field $\Field=\{0,1\}$ as a classical
bit, this would suggest that the passage to quantum codes involves
taking superpositions over these two bit values.
Indeed this is what we do.
The two dimensional complex Hilbert space that we get
is known as a \emph{qubit}:
$$
    \Complex[\Field] = \{ \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1} \}.
$$
Notice how we put the $\Field$-linear values inside the ket.
Taking $n-$fold tensor products
of a qubit corresponds to superpositions over
$n$ dimensional $\Field$-linear values.
This basis we call the \emph{computational basis.}
