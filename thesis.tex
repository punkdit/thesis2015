\begin{abstract}
Like their classical counterparts,
quantum codes are designed to protect quantum
information from noise.
From the perspective of information theory
one considers the operations required to restore
the encoded information given a syndrome which
diagnoses the noise.
From a more physics perspective, one considers
systems whose energetically protected groundspace
encodes the information.
In this work we show that standard error correction
procedures can be applied to systems where the
noise appears as non-abelian Fibonacci anyons.
In the case of a Hamiltonian with non-commuting
terms, we build a theory describing the spectrum of
these models,  
with particular focus on the 3D gauge color code model.
Numerics support the conjecture that this model is gapped,
which one would expect for a self-correcting quantum memory.

%\chapter{A Homological Perspective on Quantum Codes}
%\input{stabilizer.tex}


In this chapter we give a brief introduction to
the theory of quantum error correcting codes \cite{Calderbank1997,Dennis2002}.
% focusing on the Kitaev toric code
This will form the foundation for the rest of the thesis,
in terms of being the ``easy'' version of all that follows.

\section{Homology of a surface}

We begin with a consideration of ``size'', or ``counting''.
To denote the size of something $A$ we write $\euler(A).$
Size is \emph{additive} in the sense of 
$\euler(A\cup B) = \euler(A) + \euler(B)$ except that
$A$ and $B$ may have intersection.
In this case we would have counted the 
size of the intersection twice and so we modify this formula as
$$
    \euler(A\cup B) = \euler(A) + \euler(B) - \euler(A\cap B).
$$
We can continue this idea to find the
size of the union of three pieces
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{pic-ABC.pdf}
\end{center}
In this case the formula reads:
\begin{align}\label{EulerAddSub}
\euler(A\cup B\cup C) = \ &\euler(A) + \euler(B) + \euler(C)  \nonumber \\
                     &- \euler(A\cap B) - \euler(A\cap C) - \euler(B\cap C) \nonumber \\
                     &+ \euler(A\cap B \cap C).
\end{align}
The point here is the alternating signs:
each time we try to count a size we overcount by
one intersections worth, subtracting those intersections
goes too far in the opposite direction and so we need
to add intersections of intersections, and so on.

We now wish to apply this idea to count the
size of a sphere. The trick here is to tile the
sphere with the faces of a cube:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{pic-cube.pdf}
\end{center}
So we have six faces and one might suggest that 
$\euler(S^2)=6$ but these are closed faces, so they
intersect on their edges, of which we have 12.
But these edges intersect at vertices and there are
8 of these. 
We extend the above formula \Eref{EulerAddSub} to calculate:
$$
    \euler(S^2) = 6 - 12 + 8 = 2.
$$
So the sphere has ``size'' two!
The magic here is that any other convex polyhedron would give
the same answer of two.
This, of course, is known as the \emph{Euler characteristic},
and for a sphere this is indeed two.
{This approach to defining Euler characteristic is
discussed in the fascinating book \cite{Klain1997}.}

We repeat this calculation for another surface, a torus.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{pic-torus.pdf}
\end{center}
This time we use four faces, eight edges and four vertices:
$$
    \euler(S^1\times S^1) = 4 - 8 + 4 = 0.
$$

The Euler characteristic has many equivalent definitions,
and we now turn to one of these, which is the idea of a homology.
This theory goes back to Poincar\'e who was trying to
deal with topological issues as they arise in complex analysis~\cite{Lefschetz1970}.
%The first step is to consider vector spaces ...

We are going to replace sets of things by vector
spaces whose basis is the original set.
And just to keep things simple we will 
take our vector spaces over the finite field with
two elements $\Field=\{0, 1\}.$
%That is, we use mod 2 arithmetic when counting things.
This has the distinct advantage
of eliminating all sign errors!

From the set of faces we form a vector space
$C_2$ with basis the set of faces.
Similarly, the one-dimensional pieces are the basis of $C_1$
and the zero-dimensional pieces are the basis of $C_0$:
\begin{align*}
    C_2 &: \mbox{faces},\\
    C_1 &: \mbox{edges},\\
    C_0 &: \mbox{vertices.}
\end{align*}
The formula for Euler characteristic now reads:
\begin{align}\label{EulerEq}
    \euler(C_{\bullet}) = \mbox{dim}(C_2) - \mbox{dim}(C_1) + \mbox{dim}(C_0).
\end{align}
But now things get more interesting,
because we have the following linear operators:
\begin{align}\label{Sequence}
    C_2 \xrightarrow{\ \ \partial_2\ \ } C_1 \xrightarrow{\ \ \partial_1\ \ } C_0.
\end{align}
These are defined to take the ``boundary'' of a shape. 
The operator $\partial_2$ gives the boundary of a face $f\in C_2$
which is just the sum of edges incident to (contained by) that face:
$$
    \partial_2(f) = \sum_{\substack{e\in \text{edges},\\e\sim f}} e.
$$
where we use $\sim$ to indicate incidence, and we extend
$\partial_2$ to all of $C_2$ by linearity.
Similarly, $\partial_1$ is defined to take an edge
to the sum over its vertex endpoints:
$$
    \partial_1(e) = \sum_{\substack{v\in \text{vertices},\\v\sim e}} v.
$$

Now with a small amount of thought one finds that 
$$
    \partial_1 \circ \partial_2 = 0.
$$
This is because each vertex around a face gets counted twice,
and this is zero in $\Field$-linear arithmetic.
\begin{center}
%\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{pic-bdy.pdf}
\includegraphics{pic-bdy.pdf}
\end{center}
In other words, the boundary of the boundary is empty!
Or equivalently,
$$
    \Im(\partial_2) \subset \Ker(\partial_1).
$$
%We call the subspace $\Ker(\partial_1)$ the \emph{cycles}
%of $C_1$. 
The subspace $\Ker(\partial_1)$ of $C_1$
will be sums of edges that form closed loops, and we
call these \emph{cycles}.
The subspace $\Im(\partial_2)$ is the space of \emph{boundaries}.
So the above formula
says the space of boundaries is contained within the space of cycles.
This allows us to define the following quotient,
known as the first \emph{homology} group:
$$
    H_1 := \Ker(\partial_1) / \Im(\partial_2).
$$
These are the cycles modulo boundaries.

With a bit more work we can extend the above sequence \Eref{Sequence} to
$$
  0 \xrightarrow{\ \ \partial_3\ \ } 
    C_2 \xrightarrow{\ \ \partial_2\ \ } 
    C_1 \xrightarrow{\ \ \partial_1\ \ } 
    C_0 \xrightarrow{\ \ \partial_0\ \ } 0
$$
so that $\partial_i \circ \partial_{i+1}=0$ 
for $i=0,1,2$
and then define
$$
    H_i := \Ker(\partial_i) / \Im(\partial_{i+1}),\ \ \ \mbox{for}\ \ \ i=0,1,2.
$$

Now we have a new formula for the Euler characteristic,
\begin{align}\label{EulerHom}
    \euler(H_{\bullet}) = \mbox{dim}(H_2) - \mbox{dim}(H_1) + \mbox{dim}(H_0),
\end{align}
which follows from
%from the homology condition
%$\partial_i \circ \partial_{i+1}=0$  and
an application of the rank-nullity theorem
\footnote{The rank-nullity theorem of linear algebra
states that
given a linear map $f:V\to W$ on a finite-dimensional
vector space $V$,
we have $\Dim(\Im(f)) + \Dim(\Ker(f)) = \Dim(V).$}
%the sum of the
%dimension of the image of $f$ and the
%dimension of the kernel of $f,$ equals the dimension of $V.$}
%\danbrowne{What's this?}
to equation \Eref{EulerEq}.

Going back to the torus example, with four faces,
eight edges and four vertices:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{pic-torus-hom.pdf}
\end{center}
we see that the sum over all faces in $C_2$
has zero boundary,
$$
    \partial_2(\sum_{f\in\text{faces}} f) = 0
$$
and this is the only vector with zero boundary so that
that $\Dim(H_2)=1$.
The space $H_1$ is two dimensional, with representative
cycles given by a vertical or horizontal loop of edges.
Finally, the space $H_0$ is one dimensional: these
are single points.
Putting this together we get
$$
    \euler(S^1\times S^1) = 
    \mbox{dim}(H_2) - \mbox{dim}(H_1) + \mbox{dim}(H_0) = 1-2-1 = 0,
$$
which agrees with our previous calculation for the Euler
characteristic of the torus.

%Because we have $\partial_3=0$ and $\partial_0=0$ this formula
%becomes
%\begin{align}
%    \euler(H_{\bullet}) = \Dim(\Ker{\partial_2}) - \dim(H_1) + \dim(\Im{\partial).
%\end{align}

\section{Classical and quantum codes}

This is all great but what does it have to do with quantum codes?
Well, before we talk about the quantum case,
it is worth first going over what we
mean by a code in the classical sense of the word.
We wish to communicate a single bit of information, 
but the communication channel we use suffers from random noise.
This noise acts to randomly toggle bits.
One way to mitigate against this effect is to just
send multiple copies of each bit we wish to communicate.
For example, we send either $000$ or $111$.
Once again it is useful to think of this as a three
dimensional vector over $\Field.$
When the message is received any noise can be diagnosed
using the check matrix, $S:\Field^3\to\Field^3:$
$$
S = \left( \begin{array}{lll}
1&1&0\\
0&1&1\\
1&0&1
\end{array} \right).\quad
$$
The codewords belong in the kernel of this operator.
Any failure to be in the kernel is presumed to come
from a noise process.
Notice that this matrix is rank degenerate.
There is a reason for this: we can view it as
the boundary operator for the homology of a circle!
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{pic-circle-hom.pdf}
\end{center}
In this case, there is one bit for each of the three
edges, and the $S$ matrix will record a boundary vertex
between non-identical bits.
$$
  0 \xrightarrow{\ \ \ \ } 
    C_1 \xrightarrow{\ \ S=\partial_1\ \ } 
    C_0 \xrightarrow{\ \ \ \ } 0.
$$

Thinking of the finite field $\Field=\{0,1\}$ as a classical
bit would suggest that the passage to quantum codes involves
taking superpositions over these two bit values.
Indeed this is what we do.
The two dimensional complex Hilbert space that we get
is known as a \emph{qubit}:
$$
    \Complex[\Field] = \{ \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}, \ \ \alpha,\beta\in \Complex \}.
$$
Notice how we put the $\Field$-linear values inside the ket.
Taking $n-$fold tensor products
of a qubit corresponds to superpositions over
$n$ dimensional $\Field$-linear values.
This basis we call the \emph{computational basis.}

Using this basis, we write matrices for 
the two important operators, Pauli X and Z:
$$
X = \left( \begin{array}{ll}
0&1\\
1&0\end{array} \right),\quad
Z = \left( \begin{array}{rr}
1&0\\
0&-1\end{array} \right).
$$
These two operators generate the (real) single qubit \emph{Pauli group} $\Pauli_1.$
We call these \emph{bitflip} and \emph{phaseflip} operators, respectively.
For the $n$-qubit Pauli group $\Pauli_n$
we take $n$-fold tensor products of $I, X,$ and $Z,$
where $I$ is the single qubit identity operator.
%Because this is used frequently
We suppress the tensor symbol in such products, for example
writing $XII$ for $X\otimes I\otimes I.$

Now we take the classical repetition code and
try the following quantum version:
$$
    \alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1} \mapsto \alpha\ket{000} + \beta\ket{111}.
$$
To detect any single bitflip error, such as
$XII, IXI$ or $IIX$ 
we measure the \emph{check} operators
$ ZZI, IZZ.$
The outcome of such measurements we call a \emph{syndrome}
because these serve to diagnose an error process.

However, bitflip errors are not the only unitary operators
that we would like to detect.
Indeed, any single bit phaseflip operator, $ZII, IZI$ or $IIZ$
has the effect
$$
    \alpha\ket{000} + \beta\ket{111} \mapsto \alpha\ket{000} - \beta\ket{111}
$$
which goes unnoticed by our syndrome measurements.
Effectively we still have a classical code.

In order to move towards the solution to this problem,
we examine more closely the action of the check operators.
Given any state 
$$
    \ket{\psi} = \alpha\ket{000} + \beta\ket{111}
$$
we have 
$$
    g \ket{\psi} = \ket{\psi}
$$
for $g \in \{III, ZZI, IZZ, ZIZ\}.$
In other words, $\ket{\psi}$ is \emph{stabilized}
by the group generated by $ZZI$ and $IZZ.$
This motivates the following definition.
A \emph{stabilizer code} is 
specified by a commutative subgroup $S$ of $\Pauli_n$
such that $-I\notin S.$
We define the subgroup $\Pauli_n^X$
to be generated by $n$-fold tensor products of the $I$ and $X$ operators.
Similarly, $\Pauli_n^Z$ 
is generated by $n$-fold tensor products of the $I$ and $Z$ operators.

We now make the restriction that the generators of
the stabilizer group come from either $\Pauli_n^X$ or $\Pauli_n^Z$.
This is known as a \emph{CSS stabilizer code}\ \cite{Gottesman1996,Calderbank1997}.

Both of $\Pauli_n^X$ and $\Pauli_n^Z$ are abelian and
isomorphic as groups to the $n$-fold product of $\Z_2$.
But $\Z_2$ is more than an abelian group, it's also a field,
which we have been notating as $\Field.$
In this way, we identify these groups with the $n$-dimensional
vector space over the field $\Field:$
$$
\Pauli_n^X \cong \Field^n,\ \ \ 
\Pauli_n^Z \cong \Field^n.
$$
Using this identification, the commutativity of 
operators $u\in\Pauli_n^X$ and $v\in\Pauli_n^Z$
is equivalent to the $\Field$-linear
inner product of $u$ and $v$ being zero.

So the theory of CSS stabilizer codes becomes 
amenable to the theory of finite dimensional vector
spaces. But there's more than this.
It turns out that such a stabilizer code 
is essentially equivalent to a homology!

We show how this works by 
using the above example of torus homology.
This example is known as the \emph{Kitaev toric code}\ \cite{Dennis2002}.
Here we separately number
the faces, edges and vertices as
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{pic-torus-count.pdf}
\end{center}
Using this ordering 
we write 
the boundary operators as the following matrices, with
zero entries indicated by dots:
\begin{align*}
S_X = \partial_2^{\top} &= \left( \begin{array}{cccccccc}
1&1&1&.&.&1&.&.\\
1&.&1&1&.&.&.&1\\
.&1&.&.&1&1&1&.\\
.&.&.&1&1&.&1&1
\end{array} \right),\\
S_Z = \partial_1 &= \left( \begin{array}{cccccccc}
1&1&.&1&1&.&.&.\\
.&1&1&1&.&.&1&.\\
1&.&.&.&1&1&.&1\\
.&.&1&.&.&1&1&1
\end{array} \right).
\end{align*}

%\begin{align*}
%\partial_2^{\top} &= \left( \begin{array}{cccccccc}
%1&1&1&.&.&1&.&.\\
%1&.&1&1&.&.&.&1\\
%.&1&.&.&1&1&1&.\\
%.&.&.&1&1&.&1&1
%\end{array} \right),\ \ \ \ \ 
%S_X = \left( \begin{array}{c}
%XXXIIXII\\
%XIXXIIIX\\
%IXIIXXXI\\
%IIIXXIXX\\
%\end{array} \right),\\
%\partial_1 &= \left( \begin{array}{cccccccc}
%1&1&.&1&1&.&.&.\\
%.&1&1&1&.&.&1&.\\
%1&.&.&.&1&1&.&1\\
%.&.&1&.&.&1&1&1
%\end{array} \right),\ \ \ \ \ 
%S_Z = \left( \begin{array}{c}
%ZZIZZIII\\
%IZZZIIZI\\
%ZIIIZZIZ\\
%IIZIIZZZ
%\end{array} \right).
%\end{align*}

The rows of $\partial_2^\top$ become the $X$ type generators of
the stabilizer group, and the rows of $\partial_1$ are $Z$ type
generators.
It follows that 
the homology condition $\partial_1\partial_2 = 0$ is
exactly the commutativity requirement $S_Z S_X^\top = 0$ for
a stabilizer code.
Writing $m_X$ for the rows of $S_X$ and $m_Z$ for the rows
of $S_Z$ we have the following sequence:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:homology}
    \Field^{m_X} \xrightarrow{\ \ S_X^\top\ \ } 
    \Field^{n} \xrightarrow{\ \ S_Z\ \ } 
    \Field^{m_Z}.
\end{equation}

The $S_Z$ operators detect bitflip errors $u\in\Field^n$
via $\Field$-linear multiplication on the left:
$$
    v = S_Zu.
$$
This vector is the \emph{syndrome} vector.
We now dissect the space $\Field^n$ according to the kernel of $S_Z$.
Writing $\Field^n$, the space of bitflip operators,
as a direct sum:
$$
    \Field^n = \Ker(S_Z) \oplus T_X
$$
where the kernel of $S_Z$ are the \emph{undetectable errors}, or cycles.
Everything else is in 
the space $T_X,$ which are the \emph{detectable errors}.
The undetectable errors contain the $X$ type stabilizers, or boundaries,
which don't effect the codespace.
Also in the kernel of $S_Z$ are the $X$ type logical operators, which 
we write as $L_X.$
These operators are cycles that are not boundaries, and so they represent
elements of the homology $H_1.$

We already know $S_ZS_X^\top=0$ so that vectors in the row space 
of $S_X$ are undetectable by $S_Z.$
Note that $S_X$ and $S_Z$ are rank degenerate matrices, so
we make the non-degenerate matrices $\tilde{S}_X$ and $\tilde{S}_Z$ 
by deleting rows:
\begin{align*}
\tilde{S}_X = \left( \begin{array}{cccccccc}
1&1&1&.&.&1&.&.\\
1&.&1&1&.&.&.&1\\
.&1&.&.&1&1&1&.
\end{array} \right),\ \ \ 
\tilde{S}_Z = \left( \begin{array}{cccccccc}
1&1&.&1&1&.&.&.\\
.&1&1&1&.&.&1&.\\
1&.&.&.&1&1&.&1
\end{array} \right).
\end{align*}
We find a right inverse to $\tilde{S}_Z$ and form the matrix $T_X$:
$$
    \tilde{S}_Z T_X^\top = I
$$
where $I$ here is the appropriate $\Field$-linear identity.
This $T_X$ matrix has as rowspace the \emph{detectable errors:}
\begin{align*}
T_X = \left( \begin{array}{cccccccc}
.&.&.&.&1&.&.&1\\
.&.&.&.&.&.&1&.\\
.&.&.&.&.&.&.&1
\end{array} \right).
\end{align*}
The rows of this matrix,
together with those from $\tilde{S}_X$, form a six dimensional
subspace of $\Field^n$.
The other two dimensions are
spanned by operators $L_X$ such that $L_X^\top S_Z=0:$ 
\begin{align*}
L_X = \left( \begin{array}{cccccccc}
1&.&.&.&1&.&.&.\\
.&1&.&1&.&.&.&.
\end{array} \right).
\end{align*}
Together this forms an $(L,S,T)$-decomposition of the CSS
stabilizer code $S$\ \ \cite{Duclos-Cianci2010a,Yoshida2010}.
%\danbrowne{What is the point of this?}

To see the error correction process more vividly, we expand the
code dimensions.
Here we show a tiling of the torus, with $m_X = 5\times 5$ tiles.
There are two edges per tile, so this code has $n=50$ qubits:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{pic-toric-suc.pdf}
\end{center}
We show a noise process that acts by bitflip errors
and the resulting syndrome.
The noise process acts on qubits, this is a vector in $\Field^n:$
$$
    c \in \Field^n = C_1.
$$
So the error process is represented as some collection of edges.
The syndrome operator $S_Z$ gives the boundary of these
edges, shown as black vertices.
The error correction procedure takes these boundary vertices
as input and attempts to reconstruct the most likely collection of
edges with this boundary. This then is the operator $c'\in\Field^n$
that is applied to correct the error.
Note that $c+c'$ is a cycle because the vertices of $c$ and $c'$ cancel out.
If the resulting operator $c+c'$ is in the image of $S_X,$
ie. a boundary, then the error correction has succeeded.

Otherwise, $c+c'$ is not a boundary and represents a non-trivial
operator in $H_1$ and will therefore alter the encoded qubits\danbrowne{If this is the first place you introduce a homologically non-trivial operator you need to explain why it corresponds to a non-trivial logical operator.}:

To detect phase-flip errors, we can perform a change of basis on each qubit ... \todo{fixme}
this swaps the matrices of the $X$ and $Z$ operators and so 
the above sequence \Eref{eq:homology} becomes:
$$
    \Field^{m_Z} \xrightarrow{\ \ S_Z^\top\ \ } 
    \Field^{n} \xrightarrow{\ \ S_X\ \ } 
    \Field^{m_X}
$$
and we can repeat the same error correction analysis that
we did for bitflip errors.

...\todo{fixme}

Given any homology $\partial_1 \partial_2 = 0$
we get another homology by taking the transpose:
$\partial_2^\top \partial_1^\top = 0.$

\section{The energetic viewpoint}

So far we have been considering how to protect quantum information
using the framework of error correction.
An alternative perspective arises by considering energetic
protection.
This works by considering the stabilizer generators $G_0$ as
the terms of a Hamiltonian:
$$
    H = \sum_{g\in G_0} g.
$$
Note that in this thesis we use a neg-Hamiltonian convention,
so that the groundspace belongs to the largest eigenvalue of $H$.
Because all the terms in $H$ commute, we can label the eigenspaces of
this Hamiltonian uniquely by the eigenvalues of the stabilizers.
The groundspace is the simultaneous $+1$ eigenspace of the stabilizers
and therefore corresponds exactly to the stabilized codespace above.

In terms of error correction,
we think of noise processes as being diagnosed by a syndrome. 
But here 
effects of noise are now interpreted energetically, as particle creation.
Any bitflip error ``creates'' particles at the vertex endpoints.
In other words, the syndrome is interpreted as a collection of particles.
These particles are called \emph{anyons}
because of their unusual exchange statistics.

We can write down elements of a basis for the groundspace by summing over
the orbit of the stabilizer code,
$$
    \sum_{g_X\in S_X} g_X \ket{l_X},
$$
where $l_X$ is any logical bitflip operator,
written as a computational basis element (inside the ket).
Such a basis element looks like a so-called string-net condensate\ \cite{Levin2005}:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{pic-toric-liquid.pdf}
\end{center}
It is clear from this picture that the state is stabilized and
hence belongs in the groundspace of $H:$ 
the $S_Z$ stabilizers act as $+1$ on this state because there
are no vertex endpoints, and the $S_X$ stabilizers act to permute
the terms of the sum.

\section{Two roads to Non-abelian codes}

There are two approaches to non-abelian codes
explored in this thesis.
The first involves relaxing the commutativity
of the Hamiltonian terms.
These are the gauge code Hamiltonians discussed in chapter 2.
While these Hamiltonians are no longer easily diagonalizable,
we still find the stabilizers playing an important role.
In particular, we generalize the $(L,S,T)$-decomposition to these
Hamiltonians, and show how this relates to the string-net condensation picture.
Building states by summing over the orbit of the terms of the
Hamiltonian is the basic idea behind group representation theory.

With commuting Hamiltonian terms it is easy to find the spectral gap,
which is the difference between the groundspace eigenvalue and the
first excited eigenvalue.
In chapter 2 
we make progress understanding the spectrum of
the non-commuting gauge code Hamiltonians, 
with particular attention payed
to the gap.

The second approach to non-abelian codes can be understood 
from an algebraic topology perspective. 
A practitioner of these arts would likely describe
the fundamental group of a topological space as being the non-abelian 
version of its homology.
And this is indeed closely related to 
the theory of anyons and modular
functors which we describe in chapter 3.
Then in chapter 4, we go on to show how
error correction can be simulated in these systems.

In the abelian theory the following two
processes are equivalent (homologous), but for
general anyon theories this is not the case:

While chapter 4 relies on chapter 3, chapter 2 is independent of these.

\section{Discussion}

%\begin{samepage}
It seems that physics has a long history of surprising encounters
with advanced mathematical concepts,
long after the mathematicians
themselves have finished being excited by them.
This would suggest the following algorithm for
success in theoretical physics:
\danbrowne{This is verging on too informal for a thesis. }
\begin{enumerate}
\item look at what mathematicians were getting excited about several decades ago,
\item ???
\item profit!
\end{enumerate}
%\end{samepage}
This is somewhat the philosophy of the present thesis.
The downfall of this is perhaps that some concepts are
elucidated in an overly technical manner. However, the
author feels this approach to be useful as it makes contact
with a shared mathematical language.

\section{Acknowledgement}

It is a great privilege to work with deeply intelligent people.
In this I am honoured to have been able to collaborate with Courtney
Brell and Steven Flammia. Also, I could not have finished this
research without the generous and patient ear of my supervisor, Andrew Doherty.
His ability to understand my blabbering, even when I did not, saved me many times.
